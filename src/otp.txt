This is the perfect (impossible to break it without password) code.
1) can't be broken, because it's one-time password as long as the message
2) can be coded/decoded with no electronical devices, with pen and paper - no backdoors
3) uses special shortcuts and codes to be short

Encryption is: a+b=c. Decryption is: c-b=a. 
a=plain text, b=password (one-time pad "password" pre-shared), c=cypher text.

Alphabet(type48): ABCDEFGHiJKLMNoPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789^?!.*+-/=@$:
Entropy source for onetime pad: 6dice * 8dice, or 6dice*coin*coin*coin
Encryption implementation: paper table for encode (48rows*48columns)

THE ENCRYPTION SYSTEM

Code is one time pad.

It's like simple shift code (rot), but it uses other rotation amount for EACH CHARACTER which turns such code
from totally worthless into absolutelly unbreakable (by any analysis of the crypto text).

Encode: B+D -> E,  Decode: E-D -> B
B is clear text,
D is pad (in this position)
E is encrypted text (that can be send over computers, internet, etc)
E is again received encrypted
D is again pad (a copy that recipient had pre-shared over secure channel - in person)
B is decoded clear text

Text example:
Text="Hello", Pad="ACDBF":

"HELLO" + "ACDBF" = ....
.....   - "ACDBF" = "HELLO"

THE SHORTCUTS SYSTEM
Examples:

journalists reporting from war front can send following CLEAR text (just using shortcuts)
"IDCAN/GET/REPORTP^^" - means: "urgent: all is going good. yes we can get this report done. Just waiting your confirmation."
"EJHE/WILL/LEAVER^^" - means: "immediate: all is good, but: he will leave. We should do it! Just awaiting your confirmation!"

u-boot captain (clear text examples):
1) "FAFUEL/HAS/LOW/EFFIC?^^" 
2) "IWFUEL/WILL/RUN/IN/50/N.M./RDVZ/W/BISMARCK/$G53.9704,5.6603/F^^"
3) "EZCAPTURED@^^"

1) means: urgent: I suspect that: (good, but we have a considaration that...) fuel has low efficiency. Please reply"
2) means: Asap, I am sure that: (we have a problem, sorry my fault) fuel will run in 50 n.m. Randveouz with Bismarck geolocation 53.9704,5.6603. 
Do it soon. Awaiting your reply. We are also working on it / doing something about it.
3) means: Immediate, I'm sure that: (trouble) caputred. Tell everyone. Might be unable to communicate.


more urgent (afar waiting for reply maybe):
E J "HE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOW" R^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOWR^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVER^^ -> "he will leave" + contex = "he will leave [soon!] [we must must do it!] awaiting your confirmation!"

business:
NLWE/BUY/CARS/1000/PIECE/IN/NOV+^^
means:
We should do it really at some point: I want to offer/invite you to something very interesting: we buy cars 1000 piece in nov. I invite you and await your reply.

Message format is:
1 character, 1 character, N characters, 1 character, 2 characters "^^" with meaning:
(mode) (tone) (main body) (ending-type)^^ so for example:
(urgent, I am sure) (all is going good :) "yes we can get this report done" (just waiting your confirmation) 
will be encoded as:
I D "YES/WE/CAN/GET/REPORT/DONE" P^^
using the tables below to find meaning of symbols I,D, and P^^.

IDYES/WE/CAN/GET/REPORT/DONEP^^
more urgent (afar waiting for reply maybe):
E J "HE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOW" R^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVE/SOON/MUST/REPORT/NOWR^^
EJHE/WILL/LEAVER^^ -> "he will leave" + contex = "he will leave [soon!] [we must must do it!] awaiting your confirmation!"



Use case (historical needs for crypto and current events):
- journalists reporting events to HQ:
- whistleblower reporting: police corruption, being compromised, being framed, 
- various war officers
- U-boot officers - reporting position, reporting damage, reporting request for resupply :)
- banking secrets - robbers..
- USA funding fathers - 
- boy-scouts against occupant army - supply location...

Next letter is if speciall characeter then has meaning:

$k - KSK@ key. $B$KRND5858 means "bitcoin adddress that can be found in KSK@rnd5858" {remember that this information will show cleartext bitcoin address on computer; though using bitcoin will probably require one anyway}

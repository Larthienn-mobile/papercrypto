How does <b>OPT</b> work? Let's explain it on short example. To decode an encrypted message you need to use a primal message or ciphring key.</br></br>
<hr/>
<font color="red"><u>Example 1 (by digits):</u></font></br></br>

You have recieved a message with this content: 9 8 7 6 3 5 1 0. How can you deciphre it without knowing the key? As you can see, none of the numbers are the same as any others, and the difference between them are also random: 1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1. It's hard to point out any specific pattern, especially when the message given is that short.</br></br>

How does OPT work then? While having a randomly generated key for example: 2 3 7 4 9 1 0 3 and encrypted message you can do a simple subtraction of the given values:</br></br>

<ul>
<li>9 - 2 = 7
<li>8 - 3 = 5
<li>7 - 7 = 0
<li>6 - 4 = 2
<li>3 - 9 = 4 (If difference is negative, the choosen number is the one which position is accordingly "far" from end of sequence{1,2,...,0}, in this case it would be 6th number from end, which is 4).
<li>5 - 1 = 4
<li>1 - 0 = 1
<li>0 - 3 = 7 (as up)
</ul></br></br>

Thanks to upper countings we can observe that the primal message, which wasn't coded is: 7 5 0 2 4 4 1 7, the coding key which was used to encrypt is: 2 3 7 4 9 1 0 3, and enrypted message was: 9 8 7 6 3 5 1 0. To additionaly trammel encrypting our informationyou can add to the message additional random signs.</br></br>
In the other words, having the original message - it is suffice to each of its sign to add a value from the randomly generated key-pad, to acquire the encrypted message which can only be read by the person who has the key, therefore so-called perfect cipher.</br></br>

Code is one time pad.</br></br>

It's like simple shift code (rot), but it uses other rotation amount for EACH CHARACTER which turns such code
from totally worthless into absolutelly unbreakable (by any analysis of the crypto text).</br></br>
